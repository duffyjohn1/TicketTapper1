Project Description (1-2 pages):

1.      Description – The objective of our project is to design a train and bus 
        system using near-field communication. The main function of our app is 
        for the consumer to select a route on the app then you would use the near-field 
        communication to purchase a ticket and it would return an electronic 
        receipt showing proof of payment. Our target user is someone who regularly 
        uses public transport who wants to be able to use their phone as a 
        method of payment and people who wouldn&#39;t be familiar with the transportation 
        system in a different country. For example, if a tourist was to come to 
        Dublin they would be able to purchase a bus ticket using this app instead
        of the frustrating search for change or the effort of obtaining a leap card. 
        Some of our main challenges with this app idea is connecting our app to a 
        real-time database. We hope by using Firebase it will allow our application
        data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase 
        cloud. Another problem is testing but by purchasing NFC cards online we 
        hope to be able to mimic the scanning of your phone on a bus therefore 
        being able to see if our app is functional. By using flutter, we expect 
        this app to be designed for both IOS and android greatly increasing our 
        client base and make our app more usable to the public. We plan on testing 
        our app by purchasing near-field communication tags off the internet which 
        can be programmed to serve as a NFC reader that you would find on a Dublin 
        bus and we can therefore test the effectiveness of our application.

2.        Programming language(s) – Dart, Java
