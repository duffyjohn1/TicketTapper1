December – January 18th.

During this time most of our time was occupied by the semester 1 exams understandably. 
However, we did have time to do mock user interfaces and plan out how we are going to go about design the app and implementing the software. 
We decided the colour scheme and when we were going to implement the near-field communication and the payment system.

January 20th – January 28th.

We started the implementation of the U.I. this week.
First off we started designing the home page. 
We then delegated tasks to each other so we could maximise efficiency and get as much done as quickly as possible.
We went for a minimalist design with a white background and colourful symbols. 
We felt like that would be the most pleasing to look at as a cluttered and a messy app is very hard to tolerate.

January 29th – February 4th.

This week we worked on setting up the firebase database to work with the login page. 
This proved to be slightly challenging as we had to work out some bugs that occurred because we are using flutter.
We are providing two options to login in. You can log in with an email account or you can choose to use a google account. 
We still have more items we need to add to these pages.
