User Manual for Ticket Tapper

GENERAL INTRODUCTION

* * * * *

1.1 System Overview

Ticket Tapper is an Android and IOS application, which allows users to pay for transit fares using their phone. TicketTapper acts as a virtual leap card allowing payments can be made using Apple Pay, Google Pay or any bank card. This involves a near field connection so that the user can buy the ticket contactlessly. A ticket is generated once payment has been made. Users can conveniently plan their journey from within the app. This involves using maps and their current location. The user will then be redirected to the google maps UI where they can see what bus will bring them there and how long it will take.
